From: [[MIRAI ECHO]]

### INTRODUCTION

Omega is the main protagonist of MIRAI ECHO. Previously a woman named Vea, a fatal incident would lead to her being taken in by Xenura, where she would then be forced to undergo heavy cybernetic experimentation under XENTEK’s supervision. As a result, she would be brought back to life at the cost of being required to serve against her will in CODA’s military as one of the main 3 members that make up the elite INAREX division of AXXI.

Following her cybernization, the large majority of her memories would be erased to prevent her from possibly lashing out against Xenura. However, all were erased but the faint recollection of the incident that would lead to her untimely demise. In virtue of this, Omega has taken it upon herself to not only get revenge on the individual responsible for her death, but regain the memories that were taken away from her to take back her identity.

### PERSONALITY AND TRAITS

Omega, having experienced the feeling of betrayal from somebody who was close to her, as well as the distress from being killed by them no less, Omega is putwardly cold and distant to most people whom she meets. It is also because of this that she remains for the most part indifferent to carrying out missions for the government, no matter how violent they may be. She is also very irritable, and at times is prone to emotional outbursts and lashing out against others, and even her allies, whenever her anger gets the best of her. She also harbors an extreme disliking towards the person who killed her when she was still alive, as well as anybody who harms the weak. Thus, she devoted herself to finding and taking vengeance upon them for what they’ve done to her and whoever else she has slaughtered.

Despite her aloof and brooding exterior, Omega has in contrast a compassionate, softer side to her. She devotes herself to ensuring any tragedy is avoided at all costs, and is often protective of her comrades in lieu of her not wanting what happened to her to happen to them. Omega is also kind hearted by nature, and determined to protect those who cannot protect themselves even if it means she puts herself in danger. Later on in the series, ||after concluding her final bout with Helio, she comes to realize that by pursuing the path of revenge, she became no better than the person she sought revenge against. It is after this that she gains a new perspective on how she views the world, and is able to finally let go of her past trauma that had been weighing her down all this time.|| Omega’s strongest trait is her determination, as she dedicates herself to pursuing her goals no matter what may get in her way. She is also very stubborn, and usually will not listen to anybody’s say once she has made up her mind. Thus, her adamance is both a positive and negative depending on the situation. However, she does seem to acknowledge her faults and shortcomings respectfully, and will try and correct herself politely whenever possible should she find herself to be acting rudely.

## ABILITIES

### INSIGNE TRIGGER // OMIT

Omega’s Insigne, Omit is an Insigne ability that allows her to advance time forward any given frame of time lasting up to 3 seconds, allowing her to negate anything that may have happened within that time period. However, Omega herself is able to freely move around during this period of “skipped” time, which allows her to re-adjust her position. Omega cannot herself interact with anything while the ability is active, and thus can only use it to move herself into a more advantegous position. 

||The Second Gear of this ability, “Omit / Refragment” , not only extends the time frame to up to 10 seconds, but allows Omega to freely interact with her surroundings while the ability is in use. However, should she make use of this and interact with another person physically, the ability’s effects will immediately end.||
