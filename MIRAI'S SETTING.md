# BACKGROUND

The story of [[MIRAI ECHO]] predominantly takes place on a far off exoplanet known as ENZA following its colonization and inhabitation by a large business conglomerate known as Xenura, for the sole purpose of providing living space for its denizen, and solving an overpopulation problem on earth which had lead to it becoming unsustainable. Following their arrival, ENZA was formed into a giant city known as Avalon. Due to Xenura's involvement and overseeing of this, they have complete control over government and society in Avalon as a whole. The city of Avalon spans across the entirety of ENZA and is the only “country” landmass on the planet. 

## DISTRICTS

Avalon is split into several different districts which are comparable to states. Regardless, these districts all are connected to a single main city state. There are about 12 districts in total, of which includes the primary central state. Due to the nature of the city's geography, there is no such thing as travel ID or passports as inter-district travel is non-invasive and easy to maintain as a result.

  

**The districts are named in no particular order: Kyoreis, Asene, Xelin, Vienu, Niera, Yuorie, Aroti, Orsiru, Siqlo, Imetâ, Arxean, & Avalona.**

  

Avalona is the central district in question, and is also where the governmental buildings are headquartered. People in Avalon live inside of large apartment complex buildings or small trailers around the city, and a large part of the living spaces are very close together, save for a few small private homes for the big rich folk. An average apartment building in Avalon holds about 200-600 people at a time, and are styled sort of like hotels. Typically these complexes are situated underground to make space for the other neighboring buildings so as to not intrude much, and have elevators which lead in and out to ground level. Some apartment spaces even have dedicated floors for entertainment and dining purposes.

## WORK LIFE + ECO

The work culture of Avalon is all local business, and these local businesses are commonly family owned and are small in size. Despite this, there do exist a few large corporate owned supermalls that are made up of many of these smaller local shops. The currency of Avalon is known as Xira. Xira is measured in units of 100, so one Avalona dollar is about 100 Xira. Xira take the form of tiny disc shaped metal chips marked with a 'Ѷ', and Dollars take the form of a larger chips with the mark engraved on the sides.

## XENURA

Avalon and all of its districts, as stated prior, are all controlled by one massive corporation known as Xenura. Thus, they are the de facto governing body of EXA as a whole. Xenura itself is split into 3 major subsidiaries ; Xenura, Xentek, and Xenatlas. Xenura is responsible for controlling all the political and societal matters, as well as serving as a holding company for the other two. Xentek is the technological science branch, and perform all the technology and biological experiments for their own sake. Xenatlas is the director for the military and police forces across Avalon, including a more high-grade army coalition known as CODA. These three all work alongside each other in the interests of the government, and are all intended to assist with their primary goal. Xenura's agenda in question is to establish total power, and weed out or eliminate any naysayers or perceived threats to their societal integrity.

Unsurprisingly, this makes for a highly unjust government system. Their methods of achieving this goal involve lots, and lots, of human experimentation, scare tactics, assassination plots, and exploitation of power. Their primary task force, CODA, is very covert in nature, and there are many conditions required to become a part of it in the first place. As opposed to the more public AXXI force that operates in more places. CODA is split into 10 task forces, each denoted by different letters of their alphabet. 5 of which are reserved for lower ranks, and the other 5 are of the highest class soldiers that CODA has in their arsenal. Of this, there is one special sector of three individuals that are selected by Xenura to carry out their most crucial operations. This sector goes by the name of INAREX. 

Nearly all of AXXI's soldiers have had their bodies cybernetically enhanced through Xentek's endeavors, save for a couple of unfortunate low rank soldiers. This process is done as soon as they are recruited. However, the amount of enhancements given is dependent on their position within the ranks of AXXI, and typically the more fancy tech is reserved for the higher ups. AXXI task forces can also range in size, from 100 members at a time, up to 500 at a time. The size of which also differs between ranking. The highest rank, INAREX, is only comprised of 3 members at once. All of this is not only due to budgetary costs, but it also prevents any potential uprisings from becoming an issue that cannot be managed. Finally, as for its purposes, INAREX is only enlisted for last resort purposes, due to their effectiveness and power.

## CYNOVA

Due to the condition and state of the government, it was no surprise that there would be dissent coming from the people themselves. Now, Xenura would foresee this, and it is the reason why AXXI's lower ranks and CODA's police force exists to begin with. Nevertheless, in some low profile areas of Avalon, a secret organization by the name of CYNOVA would begin to form. Soon thereafter, Xenura would find themselves with a rivaling group challenging their rule. CYNOVA is an anarchist group that works on the idea that the only way to make the government care, is to show their inability to function as one. Albeit, their methods of communicating this idea involve performing terrorist attacks and mass murders in populated areas or large city spots. CYNOVA itself is not too different in structure from Xenura or CODA for that matter, as it is mostly bureaucratic and split into different sectors each with a different purpose. Although, unlike Xenura, they are all unified under one single organization rather than corporate subsidiaries.

CYNOVA relies on foot-soldiers to perform their dirty work. However, for larger scale missions they deploy one or more members from their highest sector, of which we will get to in a moment. Instead of having different task forces and teams for varying purposes, CYNOVA's soldiers are all working under one singular group. Despite being hierarchical and centralized in nature, they are rarely seen in one place for a prolonged period of time, and are constantly moving to prevent easy crackdown from Xenura. They also employ methods to be discreet and incognito with how they present themselves,. For those reasons, it is difficult to find information regarding them or their personnel.

The so called highest ranks of CYNOVA are 5 individuals who are a group that is in part detached from CYNOVA, instead going by the name NEIXE. They, however, still work in the interests of CYNOVA and retain their ideals. As stated prior, NEIXE is periodically deployed in higher priority missions, and are otherwise left dormant to act on their own. The leader of NEIXE and by accessory CYNOVA is a figure by the name of Lori. Lori is a mysterious individual who occasionally looms over the other members while on missions. Not much is known regarding him as an individual, and most information about him has only been speculation from those who have encountered or seen him. The suboordinate members of   NEIXE do not seem to want to associate themselves with Lori, and in fact avoid speaking about him or hinting at his existence whatsoever. This is because he has them all under an ultimatum. If they ever compromise him and his plans by revealing anybkind of information to other parties, he will hunt them down, and snuff them out. The rest of the members thus stay cautious with him, as he is considerably stronger than them and can therefore back up his word.

## MYTHOS

Despite the chaos and disharmony across Avalon’s wake there nevertheless is able to be some form of unity. Hence, there would eventually be religions and belief systems held by the people of the city. These religions are mostly centered around the celestial bodies surrounding the planet, as EXA has two moons orbiting its perimeter, and a sun that is believed to be connected to the creator of the universe. As the story goes, there once were two entities called Xera and Esthero respectively. These two beings were discontent with there being nothing, and so together they decided that there would be something; and so, they created the universe. They felt that it would be too much of a burden to bear all of creation on their shoulders, and thus they created lesser deities to oversee certain aspects of reality, and in addition to them, angels who would watch over them to keep the gods docule. And so, Xera and Esthero would them imbue themselves into the twin moons that surround EXA, and watch over their own creations passively.

The basis of this story would form 2 religious divisions. The order of the Pale Moon, and The order of Blazing Sun. Despite their different ideals, these two factions corxist peacefully with one another. Although, some members of both denounce the existence of the other. Their actions are done with the interests of the sun and moon in mind, and they often worship these two in reverence for them and their holiness.
